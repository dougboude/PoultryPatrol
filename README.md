# 🐔 Poultry Patrol

A 3D farming game where you protect your flock of chickens and ducks from predators while managing your farm. Built with Three.js.

## 🎮 Game Overview

You're a shepherd tasked with keeping your poultry safe for 10 minutes. Feed your birds, protect them from hawks and dogs, and enjoy visits from your friend Liz who loves to hang out with the flock.

### Features

- **Dynamic Flock Management**: Chickens lay eggs that hatch into more chickens, ducks swim in the pond
- **Predator Threats**: Fend off hawks and dogs that hunt your birds
- **Corn Feeding System**: Throw corn to keep your birds happy and healthy
- **Special Visitor**: Liz drops by every 3-5 minutes to sit with the birds (they love her!)
- **Walkman Mode**: Upload your own MP3s and jam while you farm
- **Minimap Radar**: Track all birds, predators, and visitors in real-time
- **First-Person Controls**: WASD movement with mouse-look perspective

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
